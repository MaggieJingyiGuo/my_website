<p>Let’s take a look at the voting history of countries in the United Nations
General Assembly. We will be using data from the <strong>unvotes</strong> package.
Additionally, we will make use of the <strong>tidyverse</strong> and <strong>lubridate</strong> packages
for the analysis, and the <strong>DT</strong> package for interactive display of tabular
output.</p>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The unvotes package provides three datasets we can work with: <code>un_roll_calls</code>,
<code>un_roll_call_issues</code>, and <code>un_votes</code>. Each of these datasets contains a
variable called <code>rcid</code>, the roll call id, which can be used as a unique
identifier to join them with each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>un_votes</code> dataset provides information on the voting history of the
United Nations General Assembly. It contains one row for each country-vote pair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>First, let’s take a look at how often each country voted “Yes” on a resolution
in each year. We’ll visualize the results, so let’s pick a few countries of
interest first,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_list &lt;- c(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, 
                  &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;India&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and focus our analysis on them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>un_votes %&gt;%
  filter(country %in% country_list) %&gt;%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(year = year(date), country) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == &quot;yes&quot;)
    ) %&gt;%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
      title = &quot;Percentage of &#39;Yes&#39; votes in the UN General Assembly&quot;,
      subtitle = &quot;1946 to 2019&quot;,
      y = &quot;% Yes&quot;,
      x = &quot;Year&quot;,
      colour = &quot;Country&quot;
    )+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=.01))+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/UNvotes_files/figure-html/plot-yearly-yes-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Next, let’s create a visualization that displays
how the voting record of the United States changed over time on a variety of
issues, and compares it to another country. The other country we’ll display is
Italy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>un_votes %&gt;%
  filter(country %in% c(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;)) %&gt;%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = &quot;rcid&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == &quot;yes&quot;)
    ) %&gt;%
  filter(votes &gt; 5) %&gt;%  # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, colour = country)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ issue) +
    labs(
      title = &quot;Percentage of &#39;Yes&#39; votes in the UN General Assembly&quot;,
      subtitle = &quot;1946 to 2019&quot;,
      y = &quot;% Yes&quot;,
      x = &quot;Year&quot;,
      colour = &quot;Country&quot;
    )+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy=.01))+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/UNvotes_files/figure-html/plot-yearly-yes-issue-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>We can easily change which countries are being plotted by changing which
countries the code above <code>filter</code>s for. Note that the country name should be
spelled and capitalized exactly the same way as it appears in the data. See
the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for a list of the countries in the data.</p>
